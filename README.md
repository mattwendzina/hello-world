# hello-world
First repository 
Hi all,
I am new to the world of programming and web development. I have been learning HTML and CSS intensively and am now moving onto JavaScript. I have heard about GitHub in a lot of places, and to be honest I'm not completely sure what it is, but I'm hoping to find that out as I go along..!
